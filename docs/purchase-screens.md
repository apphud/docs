Showing purchase screen with a good discount or additional free trial is a way to win back lapsed subscriber. It will be shown to a user when he selects certain option in a survey. Usually this option similar to "The subscription was too expensive for me". This screen contains a button to purchase a promotional offer with a discount or additional trial period.

Apphud offers many templates of purchase screens for every taste. We regularly add new templates. No additional coding required: you just select a screen and properly configure it.

## Configuring Purchase Screen

> Before configuring a screen make sure you have uploaded Subscription Key to update. Here is the [guide](promo-offers#subscription-keys) how to do it.

Pick a screen you would like to use at *"Purchase Screens"* section of Apphud and properly configure it. 

While configuring *Confirmation button* you will have to provide *Product ID* and *Promotional offer ID* that will be purchased when a users taps the button.

> You can read more about products configuration [here](adding-products.md) and about promotional offers [here](promo-offers.md).


You can also use *Price macroses* in any text. These macroses will be replaced with a proper value of Subscription or Promotional offer price using a user's local currency.
